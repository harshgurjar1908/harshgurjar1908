# Hello, I'm Harsh Gurjar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer with a diverse skill set and experience in building software solutions using various technologies. Here's a snapshot of what I bring to the table:

## ðŸ’» Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: Java, Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: React
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Databases**: Oracle SQL, MongoDB
- **Testing**: Appium

## ðŸš€ Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **Image Forgery Detection Application**
   - **Description**: The Image Forgery Detection Application, a project that combines the power of deep learning and React to help you detect image forgeries quickly and efficiently. This project is divided into two parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is developed in React and provides an intuitive user interface for uploading images, while the backend is built with Flask and performs image forensics using Error Level Analysis (ELA) to determine if an image is forged or not.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Javascript, React, Machine learning

2. **Todo List App**
   - **Description**:  the Todo List App, developed by Harsh Gurjar! This is a simple and efficient React-based application designed to help you manage your tasks and stay organized. The app utilizes Material UI components and leverages React hooks to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.
   - **Technologies Used**: Javascript, React

3. **Sentiment Analysis Model(using LSTM) with User Interface**
   - **Description**: The sentiment analysis model utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to understand and analyze the sentiment of text data. LSTMs are particularly effective at capturing sequential patterns, making them well-suited for tasks involving text data.
   - **Technologies Used**: JavaScript (React), Python, Machine learning
